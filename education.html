        <h2>Program and Courses</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Industrial and Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Human Factors at the University of Toronto. One of the most useful courses I have taken is <strong>Human Factors Engineering</strong>. This course has been invaluable because it provided me with practical skills and knowledge to improve system performance and user experience by understanding human capabilities and limitations.</p>
